## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***
* We are going to transform this information into matrices in order to compute the future number of workers, which will be named a. First we need to compute D, which is represented by a diagonal matrix with the number of workers in each occupation last year. From that matrix we can see that there were 15 managers, 20 engineers and 50 operators. The matrix M, which also consists on historical data, represents the movements of workers from one occupation to others or workers that remain in the same one, during the last year. Lastly, b, which is a column vector, represents the number of workers in each occupation at the present moment. In the case, 2 managers, 1 engineer and 1 operator.
* Since the results we got on Python in the column vector a are 0.77, 0.5 and 1.8, and they represent people, it is convenient to show them as integers. Therefore, we expect to have 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators in a year from now. 

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
In order to predict the firm's demand for workers, we have used python. We have taken into account the historical data on the demand for workers in each of the three occupations in the last three years (y). As well as historical data on the labor market indicator, for instance the unemployment rates for each occupation the last three years (x). The results we have gotten are 4.33, 12.4583 and 7.0416. As we are talking about workers, we round the numbers to integers. Therefore the demand for each ocupation is, 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators. If we compare it to the result obtained on the last task about workers availability, we can clearly see that there is a shortage situation, where the demand is greter thant the availaibility of workers (4>1 , 12>1 and 7>2). As an upsizing strategy we (personal cylcling) should start hiring workers as well as increasing workweek and overtime.

## Task 5
* Objective: Post 1 job vacancy for each occupation to work on remote by describing the tasks and skills required. Use [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/l-Remote-jobs.html) for help.
